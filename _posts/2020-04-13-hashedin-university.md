In this article I am going to talk about my experience at Hashedin University, Which is a 2-month intensive yet fun-filled unique boot camp run every year by HashedIn Technologies. 

- Each Week we used to get exposure of new tech stacks and we learn those technologies from scratch in the first half of the week and in the last half we used to get an assignment on that tech stack.
- For each Tech stack, there were some track leads to teaching us how to learn and help us in any technical problem.
- we were divided into teams and each team was divided into sections and each section had a mentor, mentor used to help us in any problem.
- on each working day, we used to have fun activities after lunch, usually, a game that we used to play in the team and winning team used to get a prize.
- on each Friday we get evaluated on a given assignment like face to face code review 
- on each Saturday we used to have sports activity for 2-4 hr
- They were very strict about cheating in the assignment, you can't copy other intern's code.

- almost every assignment had to be tested with test coverage >= 80% <br><br>

- you shouldn't call your seniors as sir/ma'am, otherwise, you have to pay them each time you call sir/ma'am <br><br>
