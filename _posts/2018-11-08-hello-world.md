> If you really want to understand something, the best way is to try and explain
 it to someone else. That forces you to sort it out in your mind. And the more slow and dim-witted  your pupil, the more you have to break things down into more and  more simple ideas. And that's really the essence of programming. By the time you've sorted out a complicated idea  into little steps that even a stupid machine can deal with, you've learned something about  it yourself. â€”[Douglas Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams)
